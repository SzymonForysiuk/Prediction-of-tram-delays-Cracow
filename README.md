## Prediction of tram delays in Cracow

This project is related to a contest posted on Kaggle.com about predicting streetcar delays in the city of Krakow, Poland.

The premise of the project is to find the delay of Krakow streetcars, in seconds. In situations where the streetcar arrived on time and was ahead of schedule, we treat the same.
